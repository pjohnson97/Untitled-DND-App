This is an untitled DND app project created by me, Parker Johnson, for me and my friends. I want this to be a solution for all the BS that current DND desktop and webclients put us through.

2. OOC chat room/box with VOIP and Webcam capabilties.
3. Map display which updates in real time.
4. PC sheet customizer.
5. NPC sheet customizer.
6. Item customizer.
7. Simple grid-based level editor.
8. Proceedural engine for friendly/enemy NPCs and items.
9. Proceedural engine for dungeons.
10. Differing UI for DM and PCs
11. Turn-based/FFA dialogue settings.
12. Create/remove custom (N)PC stats.
13. Customize global attributes (create new elements, diseases, etc.).
14. Create/remove races.
15. Create/remove spells.
16. ? Map display is 2D like a board game with 3D items, N/PCs, spells, and dice rolls.
